*********************  WELCOME TO CONNECT FOUR ***********************
**************** by John Broxton and Nehemiah Newell *****************

Connect Four is a two-player connection game in which the players first choose
a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a
seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down,
occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game
is to connect four of one's own discs of the same color next to each other
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before your opponent.

-----------------
To play the game:
-----------------

Open the game in the console using: python3 connect_4_controller.py

Each player takes a turn by entering a number between 1 - 7, which correspond
to the columns from left to right.

Red Player goes first, then each player take alternating turns. (The Red
pieces are hollow, the Black pieces are solid.)

At the end of the game you will receive a prompt to play again. Press 'y' for
yes, 'n' for no.
